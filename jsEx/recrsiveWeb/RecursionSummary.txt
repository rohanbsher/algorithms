Recursion is a divide and conquer algorithmic design pattern that breaks down problems in to subproblems of 
same types until a problem is trivial enough to answer.

this is the attempt i seal this knowledge and build the confidence and competence to be summarize
and understand the concept once and for all. I am going to figure out fundamentally how to works.

what is recursion ?

Imagine cooking a pancake and stacking it on a plate and then stacking another pancake on top of the already existing
pancake. 

 p4 -> Last called function that returns in LIFO last in first out manner. 
 p3
 p2 -> second call 
 p1 -> initial call | first pancake

 moving from p1 -> p2 -> p3 -> p4 in this order the values computed in p1 can flow to method p2 using
 parameters since recursion invovles calling the function iteself for example if we want to sum fib

						fib(4) fib of 4 is sum of fib of 3 + fib of (2)
						 /\
						/  \
				    fib(3)	fib(2)

when the information flows from bottom when a base case is reached.
