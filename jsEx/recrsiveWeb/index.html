These are three approaches to recursively calculating the sum of an array.
Any recursive pattern will work as long as all indexes are counted exactly once.

1. Dividing the first element in the array from the remainder of the array
2. Dividing the last element in the array from the remainder of the array
3. Dividing the array in half at the midpoint until there are <= 2 elements 

let arr = [5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 10] // sum = 100

Sum by separating the first index from the rest: <span id="sumFront"></span>
Sum by separating the last index from the rest: <span id="sumBack"></span>
Sum by splitting the array repeatedly in half: <span id="sumMiddle"></span>
