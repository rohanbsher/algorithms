This is a general repository of different algorithms I've implemented

The most recent being typeScriptAlgos which have been implemented with a TDD(test driven development) approach.

After forking run npm test or npm start

all the Leetcode and algortihms and test cases that I work on for practice. 

everythingAlgo.js under javaScript is the main file which has a lot of different algorithms based in JS and test cases besides.

AlogrithmTypescript is the main file under typeScript with all the typeScript code
